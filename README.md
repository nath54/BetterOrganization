# BetterOrganisation

## Short Description

A godot project to help life organisation (especially for students), with todolists, timetable, and even a sheet system to learn and remind notions !

## State

This project is currently in alpha phase, I still have a few features to add before it goes into beta phase.

You can test the app [here](https://github.com/nath54/BetterOrganization/releases/tag/alpha) to report issues.

### Goals to end alpha phase

* [ ] add a translation to the app
* [ ] add a search page to allow users to search directly for an element instead of browsing into directories and sheet element lists
* [ ] add a system to reduce the knowledge of elements with time to force the user to learn them again and don't forget them
* [ ] fix some major interface issues

### Further potential goals for potential new versions

* [ ] create a server to synchronise data among multiple devices under one account (I might need the help of some experts in the domain, especially for a good server security)
* [ ] work on a better system for multi-answers
* [ ] work on a better system for a better text rendering (mix text+latex+pictures)
* [ ] add a friend system (requires the server done)
* [ ] always fix interface issues

I also still have to create a wiki to explain people how to use the app.
