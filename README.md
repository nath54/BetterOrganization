# BetterOrganization

## Short Description

A godot project to help life organization (especially for students), with todolists, timetable, and even a sheet system to learn and remind notions !

## State

This project is currently in beta phase ! I still have to fully test the app and maybe to do minor modifications before it goes into official release.

You can test the app [here](https://github.com/nath54/BetterOrganization/releases/) to report issues.

### Goals to end beta phase

* [ ] fully test the app to find bugs/issues to fix
* [ ] fix some major bugs/issues

### Further potential goals for potential new versions

* [ ] create a server to synchronise data among multiple devices under one account (I might need the help of some experts in the domain, especially for a good server security)
* [ ] find a better system for multi-answers
* [x] work on a better system for a better text rendering (mix text+latex)
* [ ] add new themes to the app (and the possibility to change them)
* [ ] add new main screen to the app (and the possibility to change them)
* [ ] add a cursor to indicate where whe are in the timetable
* [ ] add the possibility to add pictures in sheets elements (I think it will be only urls, because it would become quickly technical to implement and complicated for the users to deal with pictures and so on when exporting/importing/synchronising with pictures on local storages, whereas with urls it would not pose any problems, and maybe with the web server, if it is in place, I could propose a service to upload pictures and get an url from them to use it in sheets cards)
* [ ] add a friend system (requires the server done)
* [ ] always fix issues and bugs

I also still have to create a wiki to explain people how to use the app.
